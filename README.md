## This code is part of a portfolio design that dynamically highlights and displays background images of portfolio items when the user hovers or interacts with them. Each item in the portfolio section gains an "active" state upon interaction, revealing a background image associated with that item. The "active" class is applied and managed using JavaScript, creating a smooth and interactive experience for showcasing projects or content in a visually appealing way.
